## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Foundry VTT v13 Compatibility**: Full support for Foundry VTT v13 with backward compatibility for v11 and v12
- Verified compatibility of scene controls, UI components, settings system, and hooks in v13

### Changed
- **WebRTC Audio Capture**: Updated `AudioRecorder.mjs` to support v13's `localStream` property while maintaining backward compatibility with v11/v12's `getLocalStream()` method
- Updated `module.json` compatibility metadata to verify v13 support
- Updated `package.json` foundry metadata to reflect v13 compatibility
- Updated README.md to reflect v11, v12, and v13 support

### Technical Notes
- Scene controls implementation already compatible with v13's object-based structure
- All UI components (RecorderControls, SpeakerLabeling, EntityPreview) using Application v1 pattern remain fully supported in v13
- Settings API and hooks system unchanged in v13 - no code changes required
- WebRTC API change handled with backward-compatible detection: `avClient.localStream || avClient.getLocalStream?.()`
